 Done:
    base requirements:
    1. gets the list of the most recent pictures or gets the list of the most interesting pictures from Flickr, depending on what the user chooses. This app should display the images in a paging view.
    2. The Service layer (code to connect to Flickr and download images) will be used within the main thread of the application
    3. API calls cannot be blocking (i.e., should be asynchronous).
    4. The application main thread (i.e., UI thread) needs to be notified once the call response is ready, so that it can refresh its display. 
    5. For this exercise, the UI should use a collection view to showcase images.
 --------------------------
    6. view model
    7. favor protocols
    8. error handling through MessageManager
    9. Remember User selection

 TODO: 
    This service layer should be designed so that it could be reused if the application were to grow. It should not be tied to this particular UI.
 
     $ replace SDWebImage
     $ replace NetworkLayer
    $ Spinner at bottom of collection view,
    $ gallary view, SDProgress on image detail loading

 
    $ rotation handling
 
    $ reachability
    $ low network testing
 
    $ test code
    $ create template
 
    $ Remember Offset before switch, recover after switch; hard if one colleciotn view;-> better use 2
    //other ideas out 2 collection views
